# PublicKeySecurity

This is an academic project with the purpose to show differences between two of the most famous Public Encryption algorithms, RSA and ECC with Prime Curves. 
The main purpose is to show how much RSA is weak in front of ECC, even with very low bit keys. 
I implemented Message Exchanges protocols which BigIntegers data type.
